Description: Multivariate Time Series Forecasting on stock market data using LSTM.
"""

"""
## Introduction
Time-Series forecasting means predicting the future dependent variable (y) based on the
past independent variable (x). If the model predicts a dependent variable (y) based on
one independent variable (x), it is called univariate forecasting. Whereas, In
Multivariate forecasting, the model predicts a dependent variable (y) based on more than
one independent variable (x).

This Example implements a time series model for Google's stock market data. In this
example, Multivariate time series forecasting is performed by determining the opening
price of the stock using the historical opening, closing, highest, lowest and the
adjusted closing price. This example uses the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to
predict the opening price of the stock by taking the input shape defined by the window
length and these 5 features.

A univariable forecast model reduces this complexity to a minimum – a single factor and
ignores the other dimensions such as prediction of the opening price of the stock is
based only on the historical opening price. Whereas, A multivariate stock market
prediction model can consider the relationship between multiple variables. They offer a
more detailed abstraction of reality than univariate models. Multivariate models thus
tend to provide more accurate predictions than univariate models.

"""
This example uses Google's stock market dataset downloaded from [Yahoo
Finance](https://in.finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/history?period1=1092960000&period2=1594944000&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true)

**Time-Frame Considered:** 16 Years of data starting from 2004/08/19 to 2020/07/17.

**Structure of Dataset**

1. Date - specifies trading date.
2. Open - opening price.
3. High - maximum price during the day.
4. Low - minimum price during the day.
5. Close - close price adjusted for splits.
6. Adj Close - adjusted close price adjusted for both dividends and splits.
7. Volume - the number of shares that changed hands during a given day.

# Prepare the Data
**StandardScaler()**

LSTM uses sigmoid and tanh that are sensitive to magnitude so values need to be
normalized.

Since there are 5 features used in this example for prediction and have different scales,
they are Standardized to have a common scale while building the model.

StandardScaler() will normalize the features i.e. each column of X, INDIVIDUALLY, so that
each column/feature/variable will have mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

"""
**TimeseriesGenerator**

TimeseriesGenerator is used to automatically transform both univariate and multivariate
time series data into samples, ready to train deep learning models.

In this example, Keras TimeseriesGenerator is used for preparing time series data for
modelling with deep learning methods.

Arguments that are passed to TimeseriesGenerator:
1. features: Passing the scaled multivariate data
2. target: Passing the scaled target column
3. length: It is the window_length
4. Sampling_rate: Period between successive individual timesteps within sequences.
5. batch_size: Number of time-series samples in each batch

To know more about TimeseriesGenerator, check the Keras documentation:
[TimeseriesGenerator](https://keras.io/api/preprocessing/timeseries/)

"""
**Leaky ReLU**

Leaky ReLU function is an improved version of the ReLU activation function. As for the
ReLU activation function, the gradient is 0 for all the values of inputs that are less
than zero, which would deactivate the neurons in that region and may cause a dying ReLU
problem.

Leaky ReLU is defined to address this problem. Instead of defining the ReLU activation
function as 0 for negative values of inputs(x), we define it as an extremely small linear
component of x. Here is the formula for this activation function

f(x)=max(0.01*x , x)

For reference, Relu formula: f(x) = max(0,x)

This function returns x if it receives any positive input, but for any negative value of
x, it returns a really small value which is 0.01 times x. 

**Why LSTM?**

Recurrent neural networks are much more flexible and much better suited to time series
forecasting than the linear models usually applied. 

Recurrent neural networks, of which LSTMs (“long short-term memory” units) are the most
powerful and well-known subset, are a type of artificial neural network designed to
recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as numerical times series data.
